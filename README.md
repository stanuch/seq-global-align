# DNA Global Alignment CLI Tool

[OBRAZEK]

## Project Overview
This project is a command-line tool for performing global alignment of DNA sequences using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm. It allows users to:  

- Load DNA sequences from FASTA files or manual input  
- Perform global alignment between two sequences  
- Calculate matches, mismatches, gaps, and identity percentage 
- Visualize the alignment in the terminal (CLI)    

## Key Features
- FASTA file input: Supports standard DNA sequence files  
- Global alignment: Implements Needleman-Wunsch algorithm for full-sequence comparison  
- Scoring system: Match, mismatch, and gap penalties  
- Alignment statistics:* 
  - Number of matches  
  - Number of mismatches  
  - Number of gaps  
  - % identity between sequences  
- Optional visualization: Color-highlight mismatches and gaps in terminal  
- Extensible: Can later be adapted for RNA or protein sequences
